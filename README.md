# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is a simple yet effective implementation of a **House Price Prediction** model using **Linear Regression**. The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and more.

The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to understand and modify for your own use case or dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to understand and run the code. You can modify the dataset or tweak the model parameters as needed.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the `data` directory. The dataset should have the following columns:

- `sqft`: Square footage of the house.
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `floors`: Number of floors.
- `garage`: Number of garage spaces.
- `price`: The target variable - the price of the house.

You can replace this dataset with your own data if needed.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a simple **Linear Regression** model. Linear regression is a straightforward approach for predicting a numerical value based on one or more input features. The model aims to find the best linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (house price).

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using various metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics will help you understand how well the model is performing in predicting house prices.

# Wine Quality Prediction

## Overview

Welcome to the **Wine Quality Prediction** project! This Jupyter Notebook-based project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wine based on various features. We'll employ a **Linear Regression** algorithm for this task.

This project is designed to be simple, yet educational, making it a great starting point for those interested in machine learning, regression analysis, or wine quality assessment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the code, load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to wine quality, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and more. The goal is to predict the wine quality, which is a numerical value between 0 and 10.

You can replace this dataset with your own wine dataset if needed. Just ensure that it has similar features and a quality column.

## Model

In this project, we utilize a **Linear Regression** model. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm for predicting a numerical value (in this case, wine quality) based on one or more input features. The model aims to find a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Results

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts wine quality.

# Iris Flowers Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the **Iris Flowers Classification** project! This Jupyter Notebook-based project focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. We'll use a machine learning algorithm for this task, making it a great starting point for those interested in classification problems and species identification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flowers_Classification.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to understand the code, load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains measurements of sepal and petal lengths for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The goal is to classify each iris flower into one of these species based on its measurements.

## Model

In this project, we utilize a classification algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers. Several classification algorithms are suitable for this task, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or decision trees. The choice of algorithm may vary based on your preferences and the dataset size.
